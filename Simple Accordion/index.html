        <p>The purpose of lorem ipsum is to create a natural looking block of text (sentence, paragraph, page, etc.)
          that doesn't distract from the layout. A practice not without controversy, laying out pages with meaningless
          filler text can be very useful when the focus is meant to be on design, not content.</p>

        <p>The passage experienced a surge in popularity during the 1960s when Letraset used it on their dry-transfer
          sheets, and again during the 90s as desktop publishers bundled the text with their software. Today it's seen
          all around the web; on templates, websites, and stock designs. Use our generator to get your own, or read on

        <p>Richard McClintock, a Latin scholar from Hampden-Sydney College, is credited with discovering the source
          behind the ubiquitous filler text. In seeing a sample of lorem ipsum, his interest was piqued by consectetur—a
          genuine, albeit rare, Latin word. Consulting a Latin dictionary led McClintock to a passage from De Finibus
          Bonorum et Malorum (“On the Extremes of Good and Evil”), a first-century B.C. text from the Roman philosopher
          Cicero.</p>

          the 20th.</p>
